            <p class="justify">Yemen lacks many resources such as water and education. As a result, Yemen became the world's poorest country with over 79% of people struck under the harsh circumstances of poverty. Half of the population lives under the salary of making two dollars a day which immense. Most kids can not afford to go to school and many people do not have access to a stable food or water supply. The struggle to surive is happening amongst many people living in Yemen in which the quality of life is so bad that they do not have cures to any disease such as Covid-19. Due to this terrible condition we want to raise awareness about this situation. We are planning to send people over to Yemen to pick up the debris from the war, and to distribute food to the people that need it. We are accepting food and water donations, as well as money. If you would like to volunteer, enter your full name and phone number so we will be able to contact you. Thank you for helping us overcome this challenge during this pandemic.</p>
